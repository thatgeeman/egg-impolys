@article{plimpton1995,
abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

A priori, two classes of coarse-grained models may be distinguished: those which are designed for a specific polymer and reflect the underlying atomistic details to some extent, and those which retain only the most basic features of a polymer chain (chain connectivity, short-range excluded-volume interactions, etc.). In this review we mainly focus on the second class of generic polymer models, while the first class of specific coarse-grained models is only touched upon briefly.},

@article{haber2000,
abstract = {Random walks have been used to describe a wide variety of systems ranging from cell colonies to polymers. Sixty-five years ago, Kuhn [Kuhn, W. (1934) Kolloid-Z. 68, 2-11] made the prediction, backed later by computer simulations, that the overall shape of a random-walk polymer is aspherical, yet no experimental work has directly tested Kuhn's general idea and subsequent computer simulations. By using fluorescence microscopy, we monitored the conformation of individual, long, random-walk polymers (fluorescently labeled DNA molecules) at equilibrium. We found that a polymer most frequently adopts highly extended, nonfractal structures with a strongly anisotropic shape. The ensemble-average ratio of the lengths of the long and short axes of the best-fit ellipse of the polymer was much larger than unity.},

abstract = {We survey results of computer simulations for the structure and dynamics of supercooled polymer melts and films. Our survey is mainly. concerned with features of a coarse grained polymer model-a bead-spring model-in the temperature regime above the critical glass temperature T(c) of the ideal mode-coupling theory (MCT). We divide our discussion into two parts: a part devoted to bulk properties and a part dealing with thin films. The discussion of the bulk properties focuses on two aspects: a comparison of the simulation results with MCT and an analysis of dynamic heterogeneities. We explain in detail how the analyses are performed and what, results may be obtained, and we critically assess their strengths and weaknesses.. In discussing the application of MCT we also present first results of a quantitative comparison which does not rely on fits, but exploits static input from the simulation to predict the relaxation dynamics. The second part of this review is devoted to extensions of the simulations from the bulk to thin films. We explore in detail the influence of the boundary condition, imposed by smooth or rough walls, on the structure and dynamics of the polymer melt. Geometric confinement is found to shift the glass transition temperature T(g) (or T(c) in our case) relative to the bulk. We compare our and other simulation results for the T(g) shift with experimental data, briefly survey some theoretical ideas for explaining these shifts and discuss related simulation work on the glass transition of confined liquids. Finally, we also present some technical details of how to perform fits to MCT and give a brief introduction to another approach to the glass transition based on the potential energy landscape of a liquid.},

@thesis{gg2017,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation was utilized to study the effect of confinement in polymer melts of varying bond lengths. Bulk systems with and without angular potentials were studied with fixed chain length of 16. Reducing the bond length relative to the bead diameter leads to stiffer chains without introducing an explicit angular potential. Another set of systems with confinement was also studied at the same chain lengths. Investigations on angular histogram, diffusion coefficient, gyration distribution, mean square displacement, intra-chain orientation correlation function, radial distribution function, single chain structure factor and density distribution were carried out in this work. The study showed the effect of adding an angular potential to the chain and its effect on static and dynamic quantities. The study suggested that confinement does not alter the static properties significantly for the chosen chain length and the dynamic quantities is what is being modified.},

abstract = {We present an extensive molecular‐dynamics simulation for a bead spring model of a melt of linear polymers. The number of monomersN covers the range from N=5 to N=400. Since the entanglement length N e is found to be approximately 35, our chains cover the crossover from the nonentangled to the entangled regime. The Rouse model provides an excellent description for short chains N{\textless}N e , while the dynamics of the long chains can be described by the reptation model. By mapping the model chains onto chemical species we give estimates of the times and distances of onset of the slowing down in motion due to reptation. Comparison to neutron spin‐echo data confirm our mapping procedure, resolving a discrepancy between various experiments. By considering the primitive chain we are able to directly visualize the confinement to a tube. Analyzing the Rouse mode relaxation allows us to exclude the generalized Rouse models, while the original reptation prediction gives a good description of the data.},
